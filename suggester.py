"""Notes:

* Data is too big process all at once on a normal computer, hence we
  reduce the number of transactions first, only keeping results of a
  relavant airport

* Depending on airports selected the number of found frequent sets can
  vary a lot. E.g. for a support of 50, HKG will have 27 while FRA
  will have 6781 frequent sets.

   --> Solution: 
       Dynamically select mininal support. Just keep on increasing
       minimal support until we find less than e.g. 50 frequent
       sets. If the process takes to long, just abort and try

* Algorithm runs extemely slow if we do not remove duplicate flights
  WITHIN the transactions.
